Database
Start with two tables movies & genres. When base features are complete, add more tables as needed for stretch goals.

Stretch Goals
Angular Material for design
Ability to edit genres or movies
Ability to search or filter by name or genre
Vote up or down a movie
Ability to favorite a movie and display favorites on a separate route
Feel free to deviate from this list and add features of your own
Variations
The following variations are available for this project. Instead of movies, you could implement the project with books or songs. Your database for base mode should still just be two tables.

Movies -> Books and Genre -> Author
Movies -> Songs and Genre -> Artist
